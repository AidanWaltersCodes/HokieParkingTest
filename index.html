                <p>The Hokie Parking System is a parking management solution to help people park around the Virginia Tech campus. This
                document will outline the testing strategies for the system’s primary functionality. The testing scope will go over the
                real-time parking space tracking, reservation processing, and administration analytics, we are also assuming that unit
                testing has been completed. This includes testing parking space availability updates, reservation management, payment
                processing, and user rating systems. Additionally, this document will investigate performance testing to make sure the
                system meets different requirements like updating within 5-seconds and handling high traffic loads correctly. Testing
                will also take place not only with the mobile app interface for users, but also with the web dashboard for admins.
                Overall, this document investigates different testing approaches for validating system behavior and looking into error
                handling/data accuracy in all modules.</p>

            <section id="test-plan">
                <h2 class="section-title">Test Plan</h2>
                <p>For this project, we will be doing the integration testing in 3 separate phases using a Bottom-Up approach. In phase one
                we will focus on integrating the main backend services and databases. This includes the Real-Time Data Modules with the
                sensor data processing, the Reservation and Payment Module, the Analytics and Administration Module, and database
                systems for all data collected in the application. The second phase will look at the performance requirements and system
                optimizations. This includes testing the caching system, verifying the 5-second update requirement for real-time
                information, and making sure the system can handle high loads of traffic. Phase two will use load testing tools and
                performance monitoring to make sure the system meets the non-functional requirements. Finally, phase three will
                investigate testing the front-end integration. This includes testing things like the Map display, registration/payment
                page, recommendation page, and the analytics report dashboard. Bottom-up integration was chosen because the system’s
                main functionality relies on the backend services working. Once everything in the backend is testing the front-end can
                be safely tested after.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="phase-one">
                <h2 class="section-title">Phase One: Backend Integration Testing</h2>
                <p>For the first phase, we will be testing three different backend components of the VT Parking System: the Real-Time Data
                Module, the Reservation and Payment Module, and the Analytics and Administration Module. The module overview provided
                from the VT Parking system original document only shows one clearly defined API, Real-Time API, however we can make the
                assumption that the other modules must also communicate via API. This assumption can be made because the overall design
                of the system is a client-server architecture where the mobile app users are the client and the modules are the server.
                Therefore, for the clients to communicate with other modules in the server, it also must be through an API. Through this
                reasoning, the APIs that need to be tested for the Backend Intergration Testing are the Parking Spaces API, the
                Reservation/Payment API, and Analytics/Administration API. We’d also like to introduce the need to test an additional
                module that isn’t explicitly stated in the original document but is needed to complete FR-5 and FR-6: the
                Personalization API. This API needs to handle requests by leaving comments and ratings on parking spaces and also create
                personalized recommendations for users. These API endpoints must be tested to verify what is expected from the server
                based on different HTTP requests. Some testing tools that exist for automated API testing include Postman, JMeter, and
                Cypress; automated testing for API is important to save time and incorporate in build pipelines for continuous
                integration. Swagger is also a good tool to use to properly document API servers and provide an easy-to-use interface
                for calling these endpoints.</p>

                <p>The Analytics/Administration API backend module provides time-series statistics about the VT Parking System. The
                original document indicates this module requires a privileged user to access the data, which will need to be tested.
                Because this module introduces the need of role-based authentication control (RBAC), features of creating different
                privileged level users will also need to be tested. Now that users have implemented this phase, we also want to test to
                ensure the privileged data can be reached from the Parking API. The phase will be directly testing the following
                requirements from the original document: FR-7.</p>

                    <p>The Analytics/Administration API backend module provides time-series statistics about the VT Parking System. The original document indicates this module requires a privileged Virginia Tech user to access the data, which will need to be tested. This is like how professors have elevated access on their canvas page; whether it's valid or not would be handled by the OAuth from DUO. Because this module introduces the need of role-based authentication control (RBAC), features of testing different privileged level users will also need to be tested. We also want to test to ensure the privileged data can be reached from the Parking API since the Reservation API testing has been completed. The phase will be directly testing the following requirements from the original document: FR-7.</p>

                <p>For the second phase, we need to test the performance aspect of the system. So, the app can be performant, there needs to be caching on the latest data retrieved from the database. This can be tested by seeing a decrease in retrieval time after the first query. What data is cached can be dependent on what's the most popular parking spaces during the day. During peak times as well, like in the times before classes, there will be a large increase in traffic on the app. The backend performance test ensures a sudden increase in traffic does not degrade the response from the API services. The phase will be directly testing the following requirements from the original document: NFR-3 and NFR-4.</p>

                <p>For the final phase, we will look at testing the frontend integration of the VT Parking System. Because we'll be testing
                how users interact with the system, we need to make sure the interface works correctly with the backend services we
                tested in phase one. The frontend testing will
                be split into three main parts: testing the real-time map display, testing the registration and payment system, and
                testing the ratings and recommendations page.</p>
            
                <h2 class="section-title">Phase 3.1: Real-Time Map Display</h2>
                <p>The map display is one of the main features users will interact with to find parking spots. We need to test if the map
                loads properly, shows real-time updates about parking spots, and lets users filter and select spots easily. To test this
                properly, we'll need to create mock location data and simulate WebSocket connections that would normally come from the
                actual parking sensors. The real-time aspect is especially important here since users need current information about
                parking availability.</p>
